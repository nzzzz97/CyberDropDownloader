# Quick Start

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** it's not as hard as it looks!
{% endhint %}

### Before we begin <a href="#before-we-begin" id="before-we-begin"></a>

Python is the base for Cyberdrop-DL. But don't panic! You don't need to know anything about coding to use the tool. I've tried to make it as seamless and user friendly as possible. Just for you.

### Python Installation <a href="#python-installation" id="python-installation"></a>

You'll need to have python installed to use Cyberdrop-DL. If you are on linux or mac, the good news is you probably already do!

But I'll include these for you here in case you don't, or don't know!

{% hint style="info" %}
Cyberdrop-DL Currently Requires Python 3.11 (such as 3.11.4)
{% endhint %}

{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="python-install-mac.md" %}
[python-install-mac.md](python-install-mac.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="python-install-windows.md" %}
[python-install-windows.md](python-install-windows.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Installing Cyberdrop-DL <a href="#installing-cyberdrop-dl" id="installing-cyberdrop-dl"></a>

There are two ways you can install Cyberdrop-DL. One is the easy method that I've created for you. It is just a simple file that you can open and it'll run. The other method is installation using pip, and should be considered for advanced users.

{% content-ref url="cyberdrop-dl-install-easy.md" %}
[cyberdrop-dl-install-easy.md](cyberdrop-dl-install-easy.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="cyberdrop-dl-install-advanced.md" %}
[cyberdrop-dl-install-advanced.md](cyberdrop-dl-install-advanced.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### What now? <a href="#what-now" id="what-now"></a>

Run with it! Use it to your hearts content!

When you run it, you'll need to use the edit urls selection on the run screen to add the urls of things you want to download.

You may want to look through these though. The first is the configuration options. The page below will explain what all the options mean, and what they do.

You change these configuration options through the edit configs option on the run screen.

The second link is for advanced users, and it contains the CLI argument options that is currently supported by the program.

{% content-ref url="../reference/configuration-options/" %}
[configuration-options](../reference/configuration-options/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../reference/cli-arguments.md" %}
[cli-arguments.md](../reference/cli-arguments.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You may also want to peek at what websites the program actually supports:

{% content-ref url="../reference/supported-websites.md" %}
[supported-websites.md](../reference/supported-websites.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Or if you are having issues, perhaps the FAQ might help you!
